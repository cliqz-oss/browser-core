# This hook prevents push of commits where the log message doesn't conform to
# style guide format: "EX-XXXX: Description".
#
# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status, but before
# anything has been pushed.
# If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>
