# Offers-v2

Welcome to offers-v2, backend for myoffrz which was developed according
to the most stringent data privacy and protection standards. We never
process personal data, we do not store such data centrally on a server
and, on top of that, we do not profile you. No personal data ever leaves
your device and therefore always remains in your possession.

This README is meant to guide you through the process of using offers-v2.
The offers are sent to a browser and stay in the background until they
are triggered. An offer is displayed in a browser only when you are
interested in one specific offer at a given time (but sometimes we show
offer of the week, that is untargeted). For example, if you are searching
online for particular sports footwear, you might see an offer from one
of our e-commerce clients that includes a discount, meaning that
you will be targeted only if you are really looking for an offer.

# Terminology

Offers-v2 is still evolving, but some concepts are here to stay, so
before you read further, make sure you are familiar with the following
definitions:

* **Offer**: model of ads to be shown in one the real estates, e.g. RewardBox
* **Campaign**: may contain multiple offers
* **Monitor**: lifecycle of the offer, e.g if user clicks on a offer, offer
will record information about landing page and only about landing page
* **Intent**: is user interested in one specific offer
* **Signal**: this info will be sent to the server
* **Category**: categories from e-commerce clients
* **Trigger**: set of rules on which we decide to show or not an offer

# What does Offers-v2 provide

Offers-v2 provides integration with server side by collecting offers,
also plays like backend for all real estates, e.g. RewardBox or promobar.
